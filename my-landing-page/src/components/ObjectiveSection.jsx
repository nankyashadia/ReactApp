        The idea of establishing NGO came up during the various activities with other NGOs as a part of collaboration with NSS/NCC in college activities. It was a very clear view behind the organization that it will be for young people and specially students development activities will be given priority.

        Keeping the ethics and value system in center, the NGO has thought for such activities, which will fill valuable qualities in the youth. NGO is thankful to all the young students of various colleges who are voluntarily giving a boost to the activities. For spreading awareness in the field of adventure, NGO has planned some very charming events as per regular basis.
