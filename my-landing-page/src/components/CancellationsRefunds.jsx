      <p className="mb-4">
        In the event that you cancel your booking, in full or partially, Afrika Safari will levy cancellation charges as defined in the section below. This is only different if the traveler terminates the contract because he does not accept a proposal for a substantial change to the trip or if the trip is canceled by the traveler if unavoidable and unforeseeable circumstances occur at the place of destination that significantly affect the execution of the trip. In these situations, Afrika Safari will not charge cancellation fees if she believes that the traveler can validly appeal to the situations mentioned above.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>61+ days before departure: deposit non-refundable</li>
        <li>0–61 days before departure: 100% of the itinerary cost</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3.2 Cancellation by AS</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
      Whilst we always endeavor to avoid cancellations, we reserve the right to cancel your holiday for the reasons and respecting the deadlines specified below.      </p>

      <h4>Reasons:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>If you don't comply with your duty to pay the travel sum.</li>
        <li>If we have a legitimate fear that you will not or not fully pay the travel sum, before payment has become claimable.</li>
        <li>When, on a date specified in the agreement, it becomes clear that the minimum number of participants is insufficient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 >Deadlines:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>For trips of more than 6 days: termination will have to be done not later than 20 days before departure.</li>
        <li>For trips of 2–6 days: termination will have to be done not later than 7 days before departure.</li>
        <li>For trips of less than 2 days: termination will have to be done not later than 48 hours before departure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Deadlines for last-minute trips, that is trips taking place within 61 days of the booking, the full travel price must be paid within two days of the invoice being sent, regardless of the default 10 days deadline mentioned on the invoice document. If the traveler fails to pay on time, they will be in legal default and the contract may be terminated immediately by AS      </p>
