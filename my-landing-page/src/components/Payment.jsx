          Payments can be made by bank wire/transfer, debit or credit card as well as other direct card payments.
          After clients accept a proposal, they receive an invoice with all details. We require a 50% deposit payment of the itinerary cost within 10 days of receiving the invoice and 100% upfront payment if the booking was made within 61 days prior to departure. We cannot guarantee a booking if a deposit or a full amount is delayed.
          If clients book international airline tickets with us, we require 100% payment within a specified reservation deadline.
          In both cases, full payment must be made no later than 61 days before the departure date. Failure to make full payment by this deadline gives us the right to cancel the holiday and apply the applicable cancellation charges (refer to section 5.3.1). The travel agreement will then be automatically dissolved and you will receive a notification prior. In such cases, we bear no liability and cancellation is without penalty to us. The lead booking name is responsible for full payment on behalf of the entire party, and all members agree to the stated conditions. The lead booking name is severally responsible for all duties resulting from the agreement.
