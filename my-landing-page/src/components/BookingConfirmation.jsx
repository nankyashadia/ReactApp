          After a client requests a quote on our website, we promptly send a comprehensive itinerary to their email address. This detailed itinerary outlines the various destinations they will visit, the activities they will do and accommodations where they will stay, allowing them to gain a clear understanding of what to anticipate. Following this, it is imperative for the client to either confirm their acceptance of the proposed itinerary or provide suggestions for any modifications they desire.
          The safari services agreed upon with the client throughout this process will be diligently provided, except in the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as road closures, bad weather, or security concerns. In such cases, the itinerary may be changed or terminated (see sections 5.3.2. and 6.2.).
